  <p class="content">Firefox is in my opinion is one of the best browsers out there. I know firefox has it's problems, but it is the best alternative to chromium, no scratch that, it is the ONLY usable alternative to chromium. <a href="https://mozilla.org" target="_blank" class="link">Mozilla</a> has also come under heat for being sponsored by google but I trust a  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/" target="_blank" class="link">open source</a> browser which is customizable and is only sponsored by google than a browser which is literally maintained by google.</p>

  <p class="content">One of the many complains about firefox has been the bland user interface, so mozilla has introduced the proton update and even though there have been mixed reactions in the community, but I love it. I mean, look at the interface, it is so neat. I am a firefox fanboy, so you may expect a biased opinion from me but I will try to be impartial.</p>
